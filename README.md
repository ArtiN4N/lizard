# Installation

Go to [release v1.0](https://github.com/ArtiN4N/lizard/releases/tag/v1.0) and install the zip file for your OS (GNU Linux or Windows).

<br>

## On GNU Linux

Download `lizard_linux.zip` into your directory of choice. Extract its contents using your file manager or with
```
unzip lizard_linux.zip
```
Then run the exectuable found at `lizard/lizard`. Running the executable from terminal probably wont load any sound effects.

lizard is confirmed to work on Debian-based systems.

<br>

## On Windows

Download `lizard_windows.zip` into your directory of choice. Extract its contents using some kind of UNZIP tool. Id reccomend [7ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org).

Double click `lizard/lizard.exe` to start the game.

<br>

## On macOS

There's no official release for macOS systems. Look into [wine](https://www.winehq.org) to run the windows exe on macOS.
